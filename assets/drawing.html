    <p>I enjoy drawing both digitally and with pencil. When I draw digitally, I use various software tools that allow me to experiment with different styles and techniques. On the other hand, drawing with a pencil gives me a more tactile and traditional experience. Each medium has its own unique advantages and challenges, and I love exploring both to improve my skills and express my creativity.</p>
